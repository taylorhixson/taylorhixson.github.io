## About the Project
At NYU Abu Dhabi I led an assessment of the geospatial research needs of faculty and Ph.D. holding research staff. During the Spring 2019 semester, I conducted the assessment of faculty by holding informal, semi-structured interviews. To supplement the interview data, I used previously recorded reference interactions as secondary data.

The qualitative content collected in the interviews as well as content available from previous reference interactions to supplement gaps in interviews were used to create three faculty personas.
I decided on personas as the output of the analysis in order for the library team to better identify user patterns of behavior and create streamlined and satisfactory service. The personas are fictional characters that do not represent a single user but rather a typical user in one of three categories: the novice, the professor, and the big thinker.

Currently, I am working with a colleague to turn this report into an academic article.
