## About the Project
The Have Maps Will Travel project has taken many forms in the past few years to explore different ways of sharing travel narratives. While under Coronavirus lockdown in 2020, I used the project to explore themes of escapism and memory. Initially, this format of the project was meant to include multiple updates, starting with a 30-days-of-writing sprint. Unfortunately, writers block and creative burnout kept me from getting all the way there, and now, the site is updated sporadically as inspiration strikes. However, I believe the content currently published is a good representation of the primary themes in the project: memory, escapism, grief.

This project uses a Jekyll static site and is hosted on GitHub.
