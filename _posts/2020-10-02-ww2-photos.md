## About the Project
In 2010 I interviewed my grandfather and scanned his photographs from his experience in the South Pacific during WWII for an undergraduate journalism project. Originally, these were edited into a Soundslides project, but in 2020 I decided to reimagine and repurpose the images and interview into a static website.

For this project, I used the [CloudCannon Aperture Jekyll template](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/templates/aperture/), a purpose-built Jekyll template for photography.

A challenge to this project was embedding the original audio containing the final interview on the About tab. I did not want to use a 3rd party like SoundCloud or YouTube but instead locally host the audio. However, I have not yet been able to get it to work without some of the embed text showing through. While messy, the audio works, and I absolutely would accept suggestions or commits in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/taylorhixson/ww2-photos).
