## About the Project
[Mangrove National Park in Abu Dhabi](https://www.ead.gov.ae/en/experience-green-abu-dhabi/places-to-go/mangrove-national-park) is a popular destination for tourists and those living in the UAE. The mangroves contain manmade as well as natural channels great for exploring with a kayak. These mangroves are home to many wildlife species, with flamingos and herons among two commonly sited birds.

Between December 2020 and February 2021, I scouted and mapped kayaking trails. Prior to this work no other public, online, interactive map applications containing the trails were found.

Field notes were taken to identify the different trails and their features, including tide access and experience level. The vector data was drawn over Google Satellite imagery in QGIS.

The Abu Dhabi Environment Agency manages the park. I am not affiliated with the agency, and the project was not done in conjunction or partnership with them.
