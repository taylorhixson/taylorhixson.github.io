## About the Project
[The Greening of Sir Bani Yas Island Story Map](https://arcg.is/04arS1) tries to demonstrate the change in the landscape on Sir Bani Yas Island over time. Sir Bani Yas is located off the coast of the emirate of Abu Dhabi in the Western Region. Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan established the island as a wildlife reserve in 1977. Since then significant planting and conservation efforts have transformed the island's environment.

The Story Map includes data from Landsat and Google Earth. These were analyzed in Google Earth Engine and ArcMap 10.7 to produce some of the maps visible in the Story Map.
