## About the Project
While completing my MBA at ESMT Berlin, I was part of a consulting team to present solutions for a Michelin-starred restaurant to better monetize their e-commerce store. During the project, I led a UX heuristic evaluation of the existing shop to provide prioritization strategies and cost estimates for implementing the UX improvements. A summary of findings and a downloadable one-pager with detailed evaluation appendices follows.

## Summary of findings

The team evaluated the website against a set of five predefined heuristics criteria (or, best practices) relevant to online shops to identify high-priority areas of improvement and their associated costs.

Severity ratings on a scale from 0 (no usability problem) to 4 (usability catastrophe) were used as an indicator of the effort in hours and, ultimately, cost to fix. A high severity rating (>2) significantly impacts the user experience and should be addressed. Out of 26 evaluation criteria, nine high severity issues were identified and are listed below by severity:

- 3.5: Clarity of purpose, Scannability, Intuitive browsing
- 3: Logical information organization, Category switching, Product presentation, Additional
information
- 2.5: Design consistency, Intuitive product organization

The estimated cost to fix all high severity issues can vary greatly, costing anywhere from €19,000 to €2,340. To estimate the cost, the effort in hours was multiplied by average EU freelance wages.
