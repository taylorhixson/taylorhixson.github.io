## About the Project
In 2021, my archivist colleague and I partnered to spatially activate an oral history collections. The project was born out of a need to consider ways for the community to experience the collection within pandemic limitations. The prototype was disseminated in spring 2022 using QR codes around campus as well as on the Memory Project website.

My colleague and I submitted a poster presentation for the Oral History Association's annual conference. The poster, linked in the section below, highlights the experience of prototyping with geospatial tools and designing with longevity and sustainability in mind.
