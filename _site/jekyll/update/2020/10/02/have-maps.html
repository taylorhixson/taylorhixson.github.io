<h2 id="about-the-project">About the Project</h2>
<p>The Have Maps Will Travel project has taken many forms in the past few years to explore different ways of sharing travel narratives. While under Coronavirus lockdown in 2020, I used the project to explore themes of escapism and memory. Initially, this format of the project was meant to include multiple updates, starting with a 30-days-of-writing sprint. Unfortunately, writers block and creative burnout kept me from getting all the way there, and now, the site is updated sporadically as inspiration strikes. However, I believe the content currently published is a good representation of the primary themes in the project: memory, escapism, grief.</p>

<p>This project uses a Jekyll static site and is hosted on GitHub.</p>
